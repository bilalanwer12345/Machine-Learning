## Dataset

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset is a binary classification dataset included in scikit-learn. It consists of 569 samples with 30 features each, used to predict whether a tumor is malignant (1) or benign (0).

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gradient-boosting-tutorial.git
cd gradient-boosting-tutorial
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open the notebook:
```
jupyter notebook gradient_boosting_breast_cancer_tutorial.ipynb
```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of gradient boosting
- Train an XGBoost classifier on a real-world dataset
